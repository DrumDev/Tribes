                    <h1>Our Charitable Objectives:</h1>
                    <p>To relieve the poverty and suffering of indigenous tribes in South America which are under threat from ecological difficulties and to organise and provide and work with others who organise and provide support for such tribes.</p>
                    <p>We work with various trusted charities and offer financial support for projects that aid these tribes.</p>
                    <p>Over the years of running the Saving Small Tribes Trust we have made contacts and relationships with many organisations and we know how to get the money into the right hands!</p>
                    <p>At Saving Small Tribes, we believe in supporting those on the 'front lines' of the fight against the governmental oppression of native tribes people. Without help from all of us they wouldn't have the resources to continue helping the tribes save their way of life and their unique cultures!</p>
                    <p>Donating to us ensures that your money will go to the right place.</p>

                    <h1>Run By Angela Mullane</h1>
                    <p>Saving Small Tribes Trust was set up in 2006 by Angela Mullane of East Dunbartonshire.</p>
                    <p>Also known as 'The Angel' of Drumchapel where she has worked as a criminal defence lawyer for almost 40 years.</p>
                    <p>She has helped thousands of people in her career and is actively interested in helping others.</p>
                    <p>She has donated alot of her own money to these causes and the charity was set up to increase the scale of support she can directly help provide.</p>
                    <p>She has also helped towards other areas too such as this <a href="http://smithygallery.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/reaching-40.html" target="_blank">Smithy Gallery exhibition</a>.</p>
                    <p>"The exhibition would not have happened without the encouragement of Alasdair Gray and sponsor Angela Mullane.  Many thanks to both of them for their support."</p>

                    <h1>Tribes Life in South America</h1>
                    <p>In the wide wilderness of the rain forest in the south of Venezuela, near to the origins of the Orinoco, the Yanomanmi Indian,    the most isolated people of South America live. 
                    Mining, ranching, and health care chaos threaten Yanomami for thousands of years, the Yanomami have thrived in the rainforests of South America.</p>
                    <p>Now, they are struggling as the government fails to protect them from criminal invasions, attacks and disease. As is typical of hunter gatherers and shifting cultivators, it takes the Yanomami less than four hours work a day on average to satisfy all their material needs. Much time is left for leisure and social activities. The spirit world is a fundamental part of Yanomami life.</p>
