                    <p>We work with various trusted charities and offer financial support for projects that aid these tribes.</p>
                    <p>Over the years of running the Saving Small Tribes Trust they have made contacts and relationships with many organisations and we know how to get the money into the right hands!</p>
                    <p>At Saving Small Tribes, we believe in supporting those on the 'front lines' of the fight against the governmental oppression of native tribes people. Without help from all of us they wouldn't have the resources to continue helping the tribes save their way of life and their unique cultures!</p>
                    <p>Donating to the Saving Small Tribes Trust ensures that your money will go to the right place that defies forced oppression!</p>

                    <h1>Run By Angela Mullane</h1>
                    <p>Saving Small Tribes Trust was set up in 2006 by Angela Mullane of East Dunbartonshire.</p>
                    <p>Also known as 'The Angel' of Drumchapel where she has worked as a criminal defence lawyer for almost 40 years.</p>
                    <p>She has helped thousands of people in her career and is actively interested in helping others.</p>
                    <p>Angela lets nothing get in her way and the defiancy showed by the groups on the front line of the fight against the oppression against the small tribes culture and way of life is admirable to Angela.</p>
                    <p>"Let nothing get in your way, fight for what is right and don't let anyone tell you different."</p>
                    <p>She has donated alot of her own money to these causes and the charity was set up to increase the scale of support she can directly help provide.</p>
